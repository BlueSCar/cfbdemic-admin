to do:
-define regions
  -create generic region object
    properties:
      -name
      -bordering regions
        -current border strength
      -current population
      -list of disease objects
      per disease
        -population infected
        -population contagious
        -population zombified
      -list of researchers in regions
      -FUTURE: image and location for placement on map?
    methods:
      -print stats about regions
-define diseases
  properties:
    -name
    -transmission rate
    -incubation
    -time for each progression (1 day for infected -> contagious, 2 days for contagious -> zombified, etc.)
-define researchers
  properties:
    -name
    -location
    -team
    -infected status
    -chosen action
-define tech trees
  properties:
    -name
    -status
    -choices
    -bonuses
    -team
    -users
    -count for tech trees
    -modifications thanks to tech trees
  methods:
    -update status
-define country
  properties:
    -list of territory objects
    -list of tech trees
  methods:
    -simulate a day
      -first, parse all users
      -go through list of users and apply actions to users, npcs, regions
      -update tech trees as neccesary
      -move users around as neccesary
